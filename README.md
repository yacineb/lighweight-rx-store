# TestStore

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.1.

It's a full, functional POC of a safe, side-effect-free and lightweight store. It simply uses the power of **rxjs** and **immer**, nothing more !

Because of the generic nature of rxjs, your can use this store for any Project: React, Angular, Vue, Svelte and even on backend in nodejs!

This can be alternative to other redux/flux store libraries - which are usually tricky to use, opnionated and not "Frontend Technology" agnostic.

For a typical scenario where you want to rewrite an Angular app into VueJS app, this rxjs-based store is an excellent migration path, because it makes interop easy.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
